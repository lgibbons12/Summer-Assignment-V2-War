# Summer-Assignment-V2-War

This project was a redo of the summer assignment of the War game. I did my summer assignment using pygame, a framework I was familiar with, so transferring that code to javascript would be a new challenge.
As a class, we learned how to draw the cards using class systems. This was a major learning moment for me as to that point I did not understand javascript classes.

In the end, I was very proud of the final result, and unlike the python game, I could put it on a globally hosted server so my friends could actually play the game I created which was really cool.
